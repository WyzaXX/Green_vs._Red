In the startUp file, you will see command pattern implemented and it will take you to the engine class.
In the engine class, you will see only a part of the logic which was implemented during the problem solving, things like a "Parser" for the inputs, validation of the inputs and finally outputting the result to the console.
We create a new Playground class and inside that we can see the main business logic, we validate the width and height inside the setters and if not correct throw exceptions.
When we are done with all that we start iterating through the generations and get to the final answer which shows how many generations does the selected cell stays green.
